## Instructions to import repository and edit in repl.it
1. Use Github to make a repl.it account
2. Click create new repl, then click "import existing repository"
3. Should work, you can edit now BUT any changes you make have to be "pushed"
4. The icon below "Files" is version control. When you're done editing, type in a short description of what you changed and click "commit and push"
    - I will handle the merge errors and branches
5. The .replit file controls which file the green "run" button runs. To change the file run, simply change the file name.
